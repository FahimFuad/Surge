# Surge Engine
Welcome to the private development repository of SurgeEngine!

The development of this engine is paused for a year or so and we will be back soon!

Currently the feature Surge has (on master branch):
- Basic PBR Rendering with Vulkan
- C++ Scripting
- Automated Serializer 
- Some other cool stuff, that I forgot

TODO:
- Improve the performance of current PBR pipeline
- Add GI
- Optimize the Script Engine
- Add an Asset manager
- Improve the whole ECS structure
- Stop doing `delete Surge::Engine();` in C++ script, because that is kinda bad, right?
- Add Vulkan Ray Tracing pipeline
- Some other cool stuff, that I forgot
